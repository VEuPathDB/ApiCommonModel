                Find genes that have modified annotation based on the recent <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> annotation workshop.  Modified annotation includes gene models, GO and EC assignments and product names. <p>
<br><br>
<b><i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> reannotation workshop:</b>  
The effort to systematically update the annotation for <i>P. falciparum</i> 3D7 genome started in October 2007 with a weeklong workshop co-organized by staff from the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute (WTSI) and the EuPathDB team. The Wellcome Trust and Burroughs Wellcome Fund-sponsored workshop was held in Hinxton, UK and was attended by nearly 30 Plasmodium researchers contributing expertise in various aspects of Plasmodium biology, plus more than 10 bioinformatics support staff from the Artemis, GeneDB and EuPathDB teams. During the workshop 2700 genes were edited using Artemis and ACT software, mainly with the addition of new or alternative functional descriptions (e.g. product names, GO terms, EC numbers and miscellaneous textual comments). 
<p>
After the workshop, intensive manual reannotation of the genome has continued at WTSI with the help of several members of the community. First, the structures of more than 700 gene models have been changed and new gene models have been added. In addition, curation staff at GeneDB have reviewed all User Comments submitted to PlasmoDB. Over the coming months, the emphasis will switch to a careful genome-wide review of functional annotation.
<p>
The annotation presented here in PlasmoDB is the second snapshot of a work in progress and intended to inform you about the new annotation and elicit any feedback that you may have. Please add a User Comment to any gene about which you have additional information. This information is forwarded to the GeneDB curators on a weekly basis and will be included in the next snapshot.  In order to expedite the annotation, the following are of particular value to the manual curators:  
<ol>
<li>New product names with the PubMed ID of the paper in which they were first cited,  
<li>Additional PubMed IDs of any papers from which the function of the gene/protein can be ascribed
<li>EC number
<li>Alternative/updated gene names and aliases.
<li>Evidence that a gene tructure has been incorrectly called.  Please include a description of the evidence that you have used (e.g. full length cDNA) and the new sequence.
</ol>

           <![CDATA[
Identify <i>T. brucei</i>  genes based on comparisons of RNAi target sequencing coverage at different life cycle stages.  
Genes returned by this search have coverage (RPKM) values in Comparison Sample(s) that is less than that of the Uninduced Control. <br><br>



In this experiment an RNAi plasmid library, containing randomly sheared genomic fragments was used to create an inducible library in bloodstream form <i>T. brucei</i>. 
After transfection, the library was grown under non-inducing and inducing conditions and genomic DNA was isolated from surviving populations. Adapter-ligated sequencing libraries were prepared from each genomic DNA sample and used to amplify DNA fragments containing RNAi cassette-insert junctions in semi-specific PCR reactions. Size-selected DNA was sequenced with cycle paired-end runs on an Illumina GAII. Number of reads mapping to protein-coding sequences (CDS) were scored for each experiment.<br><br>
Four different induced samples were examined, bloodstream-form cells grown for three (BFD3) or six days (BFD6), insect/procyclic-form cells (PF), and cells induced throughout growth as bloodstream forms, differentiation and growth as procyclic forms (DIF). BFD3, BFD6, PF and DIF cultures were grown under inducing conditions (Tetracycline) for the equivalent of approximately 10, 20, 9 and 13 (7+6) population doubling (PD) times respectively (1PD~7 h for BF cells and ~24 h for PF cells). 
<br><br>
Cells carrying RNAi target fragments that negatively impact fitness through dsRNA expression and RNAi-mediated ablation are relatively depleted as the population expands and these changes are reported by the depth of sequence coverage relative to the uninduced control (No Tet).<br><br>
For further details, please refer the following manuscript: <a href="http://genome.cshlp.org/content/early/2011/03/17/gr.115089.110">High-throughput phenotyping using parallel sequencing of RNA interference targets in the African trypanosome.</a>
<br><br>
The following four searches return the lists of genes from this paper that show significant loss of fitness (Z-scores >= 3.3) for each of the stages tested in this experiment.
<br><br>
<ul>
<li><a href="@LEGACY_WEBAPP_BASE_URL@/im.do?s=b0f067c5bed96e42">Blood form day 3</a></li>
<li><a href="@LEGACY_WEBAPP_BASE_URL@/im.do?s=85a725b9f604d4d2">Blood form day 6</a></li>
<li><a href="@LEGACY_WEBAPP_BASE_URL@/im.do?s=c89f311e3b0810e5">Procyclic form</a></li>
<li><a href="@LEGACY_WEBAPP_BASE_URL@/im.do?s=d0a76450ba83b287">Differentiation</a></li>
</ul>
<br>
This strategy shows loss of fitness in <a href="@LEGACY_WEBAPP_BASE_URL@/im.do?s=90e8dbf579cdc556">all four of the above samples</a>.

<sup>1</sup> The DIF sample involved RNAi induction throughout growth as bloodstream forms, differentiation and growth as procyclic 
forms, so that any gene required for growth in either life-cycle stage or for differentiation should register a loss-of-fitness in this sample.<br><br><br>

<br><br>
<b>Note:</b> These data were re-analyzed as part of the loading protocol for TriTrypDB.  RPKM values and P values were computed for CDS sequences and annotated 
gene models (primarily just 5' UTR + CDS since only 10 genes have annotated 3' UTRs currently).  Alsford et. al. used the CDS for their analyses since the 
annotation of UTRs is less reliable.  Differences in the results can be clearly seen when comparing these two methods.  For example 
by <a href="@LEGACY_WEBAPP_BASE_URL@/showRecord.do?name=GeneRecordClasses.GeneRecordClass&source_id=Tb927.8.2780&project_id=TriTrypDB">Tb927.8.2780</a>.  This gene was shown 
in Alsford et. al. to cause significant loss of fitness in all stages with there being zero reads for BFD3 and BFD6 while the entire gene model 
analysis shows there to be no decrease in reads in any stage.  When we examined the coverage in GBrowse for this region we found that all the 
alignments in this gene in blood form stages were to the 5' UTR and in fact, there is a predominant splice leader addition site for blood form 
stages between the alignments and the CDS, thus explaining the differences.

           This search returns genes with a particular phenotype score from a loss of function CRISPR screen. 
           
           Clones with guide RNAs for genes that contribute to fitness will grow slowly in the loss of function 
           screen and have a negative phenotype score. <br><br>
           
           Loss of Funciton CRISPR Screen:<br>
           <i>T. gondii</i> parasites constiutively expressing Cas9 were transfected with a library of quide RNAs.  
           After culturing for 3 lytic cycles, guide RNA frequency and composition was determined by DNA sequencing.<br><br>
           
           Phenotype Score (Fitness):<br>
           A gene's contribution to fitness is reflected in the frequency of guide RNAs remaining after 3 
           lytic cycles.  The phenotype score is defined as the abundance of guide RNA sequence compared to the 
           original sequence composition of the library. Phenotype scores in this data set range from -6.89 to 2.96. <br><br> 
           
           Phenotype = log2(gRNA of infected cultures / gRNA composition of original library)<br><br>

             Molecular weights are machine calculated from the raw translation and do not take into account any protein or residue modifications. For translations containing ambiguous amino acid codes (B, Z, X) the calculation uses the average of the upper and lower bound of the molecular weight.

          <br><br>
          
          First select the Organism(s) you wish to query. The search will return genes from these organisms. 
          
          Then choose the Source of Assignment.  integrated EC numbers from several sources.  EC assignments 
          from more than one source may be queried in a single search. Genes 
          returned by the search will have EC assignements from the Source that you select here.<br><br>
          
          Next indicate the EC Number or Term you wish to query. Begin typing an EC number or name to 
            see a list of all possible EC categories that match what you have typed. Then choose an EC category from 
            the list. <br><br>
            Alternatively, you can type in EC numbers or descriptions.  You can use '-' or '*' in place of numbers to denote partial EC Numbers, for example, 
          '2.7.7.-'. or *kinase* <br><br>

             Note that if you do not care about one of the parameters, don't change the defaults
             on that parameter and you will get all genes irrespective of that parameter.
             For example, running this search 
             to compare 3D7 and Dd2 using default parameters returns 2577 genes.  Among the top 20 on the list
             are CLAG, AMA1, chloroquine resistance marker and multiple PfEMP1 and SURFIN genes.
             <p>Note: Due to the extreme codon bias in the falciparum genome, the ratio of non-synonymous
             to synonymous snps per gene is much higher than expected so this should be considered when creating queries.
             We are intending to calculate more reliable normalized Dn/Ds or Ka/Ks ratios in subsequent releases of PlasmoDB.

            @PROJECT_ID@ maps peptides from proteomics experiments to a reference genome and allows you to search for 
            genes based on that mapping. Expand the Experiment/Samples parameter to see a list of proteomics datasets 
            integrated into @PROJECT_ID@. The list is organized by: <br><br>
            <ol><li>the organism that the peptides are mapped to</li>
            <li>the experiment name (model organism)</li>
            <li>the samples analyzed in the experiment</li></ol>
            
            The stringency of the search can be adjusted using the "Minimum Number of Spectera / Sample" 
            and "Minimum Number of Unique Peptide Sequences". <br>
            <u>Minimum Number of Spectra / Sample:</u><br>
            Use this parameter to set a minimum for the number of mass spectra that must support a sample (all peptides) before a gene is returned for this sample (note that this number is the sum of spectra for all peptides / sample).  
            This parameter can be considered a measure of protein abundance within a particular sample.<br><br>
            
            <u>Minimum Number of Unique Peptide Sequences:</u><br>
            Use this parameter to define the number of unique peptides that must map to a gene before the gene is returned by 
            the search. Although protein expression is confirmed with the mapping of one unique pepetide, requiring more 
            than one peptide to map to a gene will ensure that false positives are not returned by the search.  Note that the next parameter controls whether to apply this number per sample or across all samples.<br><br>
            
            <u>Apply min # peptide sequences / sample OR across samples:</u><br>
            Select Per Sample to require that each sample meet this minimum number of unique peptide sequences.  Selecting All will first union the unique peptides for all selected samples and this set will be used to meet the minimum number of unique peptide sequences.

             Find genes whose protein product contains a motif pattern that
             you specify. <br>
             First choose the Organism that you wish to query. Then define the Pattern to query 
             by entering a Perl style regular expression that defines the motif you want to find. 
             Regular expressions are more powerful than PROSITE patterns. <br><br>
             
             
             For example, "CC6+RK" is a Perl style regular expression representing "two cysteines followed
             by one or more hydrophobic amino acids, followed by arginine and
             then lysine". The pattern need not be well conserved.  
             <br><br>

             Another example is the pattern of the
             <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=15591202&query_hl=2">
             Pexel motif</a>, which can be represented as "R.L.[EQD]", meaning
             "an arginine, then any amino acid, then a leucine, then any amino
             acid, then either an aspartic acid, a glutamic acid, or a
             glutamine".
             <br><br>

             For a description of how to create regular expressions,
             please see the <a href="regexp.jsp">Regular Expression Tutorial</a>.

            Find genes whose predicted protein contains a domain from
            the InterPro set of domain databases.  <br><br>
            
            First choose the Organism(s) and Domain Database that you wish to query.<br><br>
            
            Then use either the 'Domain' or the 'Domain wildcard search' parameter to indicate the protein 
            domain you wish to find.  
            
            <p>When using the 'Specific Domain (s)' parameter, begin typing a domain name, accession or description, to 
            see a list of all possible domains that match what you have typed. Then choose a domain name from 
            the list. You can choose multiple domains using CTRL- or CMD-click when choosing the domains.<br><br>
            
            When using the 'Free Text (use'*' for wildcard)' parameter, type the text term you wish to find, including an asterisk wildcard 
            for ambiguous portions of your text term.  (*ase, kin*, *kinase*)  The search will query for all domains whose 
            names, accessions or descriptions contain your text. 
            <br><br>

            The domain matches to protein sequence are determined using the InterProScan program.

            <![CDATA[
            Find genes that have a specified orthology-based phylogenetic profile. The phylogenetic profile of a gene is a series of "present" or "absent" 
            calls, reflecting the inclusion of a gene in ortholog groups determined by the <a href="http://orthomcl.org/">OrthoMCL</a> algorithm. 
           <br><br>
           
           The OrthoMCL algorithm clusters proteins into ortholog groups based on BLAST similarity across at least 150 genomes that span the tree of life. 
           The ortholog groups document protein similarity across many species. Mapping ortholog groups onto the phyletic tree of life provides a framework 
           for correlating protein similarity across species. The other species that are included in that gene's ortholog group can be thought of as a phylogenetic profile.
            <br><br>
            Use this search to define a pattern
            across those ortholog groups, and find genes that match that pattern.  The pattern is a
            specification, for each species, of "include", "exclude", or "no constraints."  Click on the
            radio button next to a species to toggle through the three states.  A
            <img src="images/yes.gif"> means
            "include", an <img src="images/no.gif"> means "exclude"
            and <img src="images/dc.gif"> means "no constraints".
            <br> <br>
            For example, to find genes
            that are present in Apicomplexa but not in humans, click on Apicomplexa until you see
            a <img src="images/yes.gif"> and click on <i>Homo
            sapiens</i> until you see an
            <img src="images/no.gif">.

             Find genes by searching text annotations.  The search compares your term against the text in the fields you specify, 
             returning genes that have a match. <br><br>
             Select the Organism(s) you wish to query and enter your text term.  Surround your text term with quotation marks to 
             find exact phrase matches. For example, searching <b>"ABC transporter"</b> will match the exact phrase 'ABC transporter', whereas searching 
             <b>ABC transporter</b> will match <b>ABC</b> and/or <b>transporter</b>.  Use an asterisk (*) as a wild card character when looking for plural or compound words. For example, 
             to find all compound words that start with phospho (ie. phosphodiesterase), type phospho<b>*</b> in the search window.<br><br>


<u><i>Hints</i></u>:  The search is similar to Google -- if you enter multiple words, genes that match more of those 
words will have a better score than those that match fewer of the words.  If the words are found close together, that also 
improves the score.  Higher scores appear at the top of your result list. <br><br> 

<u><i>Note about non-relevant results</i></u>:  
Depending on how you configure it, this text search may return "non-relevant" genes (false positives).  The search mechanically 
matches the term you supply against the Fields that you choose. The presence of your term in that field does 
not necessarily mean that the term <i>actually describes the gene</i>.  The term may be mentioned in that field for less relevant reasons.  
To work around this, please carefully choose the Fields you want to search, and then, before drawing any conclusions, review the reference 
to your term in all matched fields in the gene page to confirm the meaning of its mention. The "Gene product" field is the most stringent 
and is unlikely to return false positives.

          <br><br><i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> transcription-factor binding sites - Manuel Llinas<br><br>
          The DNA sequence motifs bound by each ApiAP2 transcription factor were
derived from protein binding microarray data using <i>P. falciparum</i> AP2
domains.  Protein binding microarrays are non-organism specific and
contain matches to all contiguous 10-mers at least once and
non-palindromic 8-mers up to 32 times.  The DNA motifs were determined
using purified recombinant AP2 domains and the resulting position weight
matrix for each AP2 domain was used to search upstream regions for
significant matches.  The AP2 domain that binds to each motif is
indicated at the end of the gene ID.  Binding sites are based on
sequence matches only and have not been verified <i>in vivo</i>.<br>  For further information, contact Manuel Llinas: manuel@princeton.edu

<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16998473">Compact, universal DNA microarrays to comprehensively determine transcription-factor binding site specificities</a><br><br>
The AP2 motifs were mapped to the genome using the algorithm described in the following paper: <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12370781">Identification of transcription factor binding sites in the human genome sequence</a><br>
The P value is the probability that the binding site with that score would match at that position given the input DNA (intergenic and telomeric regions).  For example, a P value of 1X10<sup>-4</sup> means that you would find a good match every 10,000 base pairs on average on that strand.

              EST overlap with an annotated gene is a useful way to verify gene predictions but the absence of overlapping ESTs does not mean that a gene is not expressed.

              Find <i>C. muris</i> and <i>C. parvum</i> genes that overlaps with an Expressed Sequence Tag (EST).<p>
              EST overlap with an annotated gene is a useful way to verify gene predictions.  
              Ideally we would have EST sequences for each gene prediction, but this is not 
              the case in <i> Cryptosporidium </i> . Useful lengths of sequence overlap between an 
              EST sequence and a predicted gene sequence are usually 50nt or greater. 
              <i>C. muris</i> and <i>C. parvum</i> ESTs were clustered against their respective genomes. 
              The cluster consensus sequences are available via the graphical genome
              browser on the gene record pages.
              Genes from the MRC-LMB sequencing of chromosome 6 are not included at

<u>Gene ID</u><br>
Enter the ID of the gene for which you want to find interaction partners. Genes returned by this search have protein products that 
were identified as interacting with the protein product of the Gene ID you enter here. <br><br> 

<u>Number of searches that found this interaction</u><br>
Indicate the number of independent yeast two-hybrid screens in which a given interaction was found before a gene 
(the interacting partner) is returned by the search. This parameter can also be considered "Times Reproduced". 
Interactions found in more than one yeast two-hybrid screen are more likely 
to be true positives because the data were independently produced. 

<br><br>
<u>Number of times this interaction was found</u>
Indicate the total number of times a given interaction was identified in all yeast two-hybrid screens before a gene 
(the interacting partner) is returned by the search. This parameter can also be considered "Times Observed".
<br><br>
 
An  interaction can be identified multiple times in the same screen for several reasons (see 1-3 below) but only (3) 
provides independent confirmation of a putative interaction. <br>
(1) The original yeast cell containing 
the pair of interacting proteins divided before being plated on selective media;<br>
(2) The same prey plasmid was present in the 
library multiple times giving rise to multiple positive colonies;<br>
(3) The prey  gene was present in the library as 
multiple independent, overlapping  fragments, all of which interact with a given bait.  

<br><br>
<u>Specified protein is bait or prey</u><br>
Indicate whether the protein product of the Gene ID should be the bait (fused to the binding domain) 
or prey (fused to the activation domain) in the yeast two-hybrid experiment.

induction and the direction of regulation.<br><br>

Expression values at every time point for a gene were normalized to the corresponding expression value of 18s rRNA (see description below for a detailed explanation). Median expression value across the replicates was then computed at each time point for every gene. Expression values for every gene were then standradized to the highest value across time points (with the highest value = 1 and remaining time points scaled proportionally).<br><br>

            <![CDATA[
Find genes which are differentially expressed in a Microarray experiment.  First choose an experiment as the available samples may change.  If only one "Experiment" is shown, this field will be selected for you.
<br/><br/>
After selecting samples you have the option to take the average, minimum, or maximum expression value within each group.  (If choosing only one sample from a group, the selected 'operation' will not affect your results).  Time series experiments will offer an extra parameter called "Global min/max" which allows you to filter your results further.  Finally, you can choose the directionality and the magnitude of the difference.  For example, selecting up-regulated with a fold difference of 2 will only show results where the comparator is twice that of the reference.

Find genes which are expressed in a Microarray experiment.  For each Experiment and Sample, genes were ranked by expression level.  This search enables you to find genes w/in a specified range of values.  This search does allow you to search for genes with low levels of expression, however, care should be taken when drawing conclusions because there are many factors which may contribute to a negative result.

<br><br>The RH<sup>TK+</sup> strain used in this analysis expresses a fusion protein of herpes simplex thymidine kinase and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10496908">Radke and White</a>).  Synchronization of RH<sup>TK+</sup> parasites with thymidine followed published protocols (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10496908">Radke and White</a>).  In this synchrony model parasites released from thymidine immediately progress through S, mitosis and then cytokinesis.  The first G1 phase is the start of the next cycle.  All time points represent microarray hybridization results from duplicate, independent biological replicates.  Parasites were seeded at an MOI of 1:1 in HFF cells, and grown for 12 h at 37<sup>o</sup>C (4-8 parasites per vacuole).  To block RH<sup>TK+</sup> growth, overnight culture media was replaced with pre-warmed DMEM media containing 1% fetal bovine serum and 10 &micro;M thymidine.  The flasks were incubated for 4 h at 37<sup>o</sup>C and then quickly washed 2x with pre-warmed DMEM (no serum) with the second wash immediately replaced with pre-warmed DMEM media containing 1% serum (three total washes).  RH<sup>TK+</sup> parasites from multiple T175cm<sup>2</sup> flasks (10-20 flasks per RNA sample) were purified from host cells for RNA isolation every hour post-thymidine release using standard protocols.  R0 time point=thymidine blocked population.  Asynchronous RH<sup>TK+</sup> samples were harvested from mid-log cultures (8 and 16 parasites/vacuole).  The R0-12 time course represents ~1-2/3 divisions with tachyzoite cell cycle phase repeats R1,R2=R8,R9, R3=R10, R4=R11, and R5=R12 (<a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0012354">Behnke et al., 2010</a>)

   <p> <b>Figure 1.  Synchronization of tachyzoite populations by reversible thymidine-inhibition.</b>  The average vacuole size (black boxes) and fraction of parasites containing internal daughters (black triangles) were determined in RH<sup>TK+</sup> parasite cultures growth-inhibited by thymidine.  At hour intervals through 12 h post-thymidine release, infected monolayers were fixed and stained with anti-IMC1.  Vacuole size and the internal daughter fraction were determined in 100 vacuoles selected at random.  The synchronous division of these populations is evident by the cyclical rise and fall of internal daughter forms that is accompanied by a stepwise increase in vacuole size that marks the end of one cycle and the start of the next.   The cell cycle progression shown here was estimated from these experiments and is validated by previous studies using this synchrony model  (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10496908">Radke and White</a>, <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11420103">Radke et al.</a>).
<hr><p><img src="images/behnke_fig_2.jpg">
<p><b>Figure 2. DNA content changes of thymidine-synchronized populations.</b>  RH<sup>TK+</sup> parasite cultures were blocked with 10 &micro;M thymidine for 4 h and then released.  At one hour intervals post thymidine-release (R0-R12), parasites were harvested and pooled for RNA isolation with a small sample removed for DNA content analysis prior to cell lysis.    Genomic DNA in ethanol-fixed parasites was stained with SYTOX-Green and changes in DNA content determined by flow cytometry (FL-1; 10,000 events for each sample).  As described previously (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10496908">Radke and White</a>), thymidine-arrested RH<sup>TK+</sup> parasites are blocked at the G1/S phase boundary (R0) and immediately enter S phase upon drug-release (R1).  New daughter parasites start emerging by 3 h post drug-release (R3), and the population enters the S phase of the next cell cycle by 7-8 h post-release.   The cell cycle progression is indicated with cell cycle phase repeats R1,R2=R8,R9, R3=R10, R4=R11, and R5=R12 (C=cytokinesis, M=mitosis, G1=gap 1 phase, S=DNA synthesis).

Expression values at every time point for a gene were normalized to the corresponding expression value of 18s rRNA (see description below for a detailed explanation). Median expression value across the replicates was then computed at each time point for every gene. Expression values for every gene were then standradized to the highest value across time points (with the highest value = 1 and remaining time points scaled proportionally).<br><br>

Microsatellites were mapped to the genomic sequence to generate a physical map with coordinates for the haplotype blocks. Since the exact coordinate location of cross-over event is unknown, two sets of locations were generated for the boundary of each of the haplotype block. A Conservative estimate for the boundary of a haplotype block starts at the first microsatellite to map within the region and ends at the last microsatellite to map in the region. A Liberal estimate of the boundary starts at the end of the last microsatellite that was mapped in the previous haplotype block and ends at the beginning of the first microsatellite mapped in the next haplotype block.(Refer to the picture below for a graphical explanation HB=Haplotype Block).<br><br>

            <![CDATA[
                Find genes with a copy number in a resequenced strain that is within a range that you specify.<br><br>
                
                Whole genome resequencing data was used to estimate each gene's copy number in resequenced strains. 
                This search returns genes that are present at copy numbers (haploid number or gene dose) within a 
                range that you specify.  <br><br>
                
                
                 You have the choice between two different metrics for defining 
                 copy number: haploid number or gene dose.  Haploid number is the number of 
                genes on an individual chromosome.  Gene dose is the total number of genes in an organism, 
                accounting for copy number of the chromosome.  For example, a single-copy gene in a diploid 
                organism has a haploid number of 1 and a gene dose of 2. <br><br>
                 
                 Begin by choosing an Organism (reference genome) and a Resequenced Strain.  Then choose your Metric, Operator and 
                 Copy Number, and initiate the search by clicking the GET ANSWER button. Genes returned by the search will 
                 have a copy number based on your chosen metric within the range that you specified.  For example, 
                 searching with the haploid number equal to 4 will return genes with 4 copies on a chromosome. <br>

                Find genes by comparing the gene copy number in the resequenced strain to its copy 
                number in the reference genome.<br><br>
                
                Whole genome resequencing was used to estimate each gene's copy number in resequenced strains. This 
                search compares the estimated copy number of a gene in the resequenced strain with the copy number in the reference annotation.
                The copy number in the reference annotation is calculated as the number of genes that are both on the same chromosome and in the same ortholog group as the gene of interest. We infer that these genes have arisen as a result of tandem duplication of a common ancestor.

                <br><br>
                
                In this search, the metric for copy number is the haploid number, which is the number of copies of a gene on a 
                single chromosome. <br><br>
                
                 
                Begin by choosing an Organism (reference genome), and a Resequenced Strain, then choose how you want to compare the resequenced strain to the reference. 
                You can search for genes where the estimated copy number in the 
                resequenced strain is greater than or equal to, equal to, or less than or equal to the number of copies in the 
                reference genome.  Be cautious using the less than or equal to operator, because regions which do not sequence 
                well may appear to have reductions in gene copy number.<br>

Find the @PROJECT_ID@ genes that are orthologs (or paralogs) of the genes in a search result.
The typical use of this query is to begin by having an interesting result in a strategy.
