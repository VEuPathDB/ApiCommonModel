BLAST is a heuristic that works by finding word-matches between the query and database sequences. One may think of this process as finding "hot-spots" that BLAST can then use to initiate extensions that might eventually lead to full-blown alignments. For nucleotide-nucleotide searches (i.e., "blastn") an exact match of the entire word is required before an extension is initiated, so that one normally regulates the sensitivity and speed of the search by increasing or decreasing the word-size. For other BLAST searches non-exact word matches are taken into account based upon the similarity between words. The amount of similarity can be varied.

BLAST uses a substitution matrix for any program that aligns residues. The program may align residues because both the query and database consist of proteins (e.g. BLASTP) or the program may align DNA translated to protein with protein (e.g. BLASTX). A key element in evaluating the quality of a pairwise sequence alignment is the "substitution matrix", which assigns a score for aligning any possible pair of residues. In general, different substitution matrices are tailored to detecting similarities among sequences that are diverged by differing degrees. A single matrix may nevertheless be reasonably efficient over a relatively broad range of evolutionary change. Experimentation has shown that the BLOSUM-62 matrix is among the best for detecting most weak protein similarities. For particularly long and weak alignments, the BLOSUM-45 matrix may prove superior. A detailed statistical theory for gapped alignments has not been developed, and the best gap costs to use with a given substitution matrix are determined empirically. Short alignments need to be relatively strong (i.e. have a higher percentage of matching residues) to rise above background noise. Such short but strong alignments are more easily detected using a matrix with a higher "relative entropy" than that of BLOSUM-62. In particular, short query sequences can only produce short alignments, and therefore database searches with short queries should use an appropriately tailored matrix. The BLOSUM series does not include any matrices with relative entropies suitable for the shortest queries, so the older PAM matrices may be used instead.

Many nucleotide searches use a simple scoring system that consists of a "reward" for a match and a "penalty" for a mismatch. The (absolute) reward/penalty ratio should be increased as one looks at more divergent sequences. A ratio of 0.33 (1/-3) is appropriate for sequences that are about 99% conserved; a ratio of 0.5 (1/-2) is best for sequences that are 95% conserved; a ratio of about one (1/-1) is best for sequences that are 75% conserved.

Amino acid substitution matrices may be adjusted in various ways to compensate for the amino acid compositions of the sequences being compared. The simplest adjustment is to scale all substitution scores by an analytically determined constant, while leaving the gap scores fixed; this procedure is called "composition-based statistics" (Schaffer et al., 2001). The resulting scaled scores yield more accurate E-values than standard, unscaled scores. A more sophisticated approach adjusts each score in a standard substitution matrix separately to compensate for the compositions of the two sequences being compared (Yu et al., 2003; Yu and Altschul, 2005; Altschul et al., 2005). Such "compositional score matrix adjustment" may be invoked only under certain specific conditions for which it has been empirically determined to be beneficial (Altschul et al., 2005); under all other conditions, composition-based statistics are used. Alternatively, compositional adjustment may be invoked universally.

This function mask off segments of the query sequence that have low compositional complexity, as determined by the SEG program of Wootton and Federhen (Computers and Chemistry, 1993) or, for BLASTN, by the DUST program of Tatusov and Lipman. Filtering can eliminate statistically significant but biologically uninteresting reports from the blast output (e.g., hits against common acidic-, basic- or proline-rich regions), leaving the more biologically interesting regions of the query sequence available for specific matching against database sequences.
Filtering is only applied to the query sequence (or its translation products), not to database sequences. Default filtering is DUST for BLASTN, SEG for other programs.
It is not unusual for nothing at all to be masked by SEG, when applied to sequences in SWISS-PROT or refseq, so filtering should not be expected to always yield an effect. Furthermore, in some cases, sequences are masked in their entirety, indicating that the statistical significance of any matches reported against the unfiltered query sequence should be suspect. This will also lead to search error when default setting is used.

This parameter allows you to apply the minimum number of peptides to each selected sample or across all selected samples.  Choose "Per Sample" to require that each selected sample has your minimum number of unique peptides. Choose "Across Selected Samples" to allow the minimum number of unique peptides to be calculated as the sum from all unique peptides across selected samples. Choosing "Per Sample" is more stringent than choosing "Across Selected Samples" and therefore returns fewer genes with protein evidence.

For those experiments where spectral counts are not provided, the spectral count is set to the number of peptides mapping to a gene.
