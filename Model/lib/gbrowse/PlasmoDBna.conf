# citation = Evigan is a eukaryotic gene predictor which produces consensus gene models by integrating multiple sources of evidence. Evigan can incorporate various types of evidence such as gene models predicted by gene finders, EST matches, protein-to-genome alignment, etc. Employing a Dynamic Bayesian Network(DBN), Evigan makes predictions by infering the most likely consensus gene models given observed source evidence. Its model parameters are estimated by the Expectation-Maximization(EM) algorithm, eliminating the need of curated training data.

The Genotyping Barcode is based on 24 different high frequency SNPs (minor allele frequency > 30%) in P. falciparum. These were selected from whole genome sequencing and affymetrix genotyping of P. falciparum strains from around the globe. The method itself uses the TaqMan SNP genotyping assay.

citation      = A physical map with co-ordinates for the haplotype blocks was generated from a mapping of microsatellites to the genomic sequence. Since the exact co-ordinate location of cross-over event is uknown, two sets of locations were generated for the boundary of each of the haplotype block. A Conservative estimate for the boundary of a haplotype block starts at the first microsatellite to map within the region and ends at the last microsatellite to map in the region. A Liberal estimate of the boundary starts at the end of the last microsatellite that was mapped in the previous haplotype block and ends at the beginning of the first microsatellite mapped in the next haplotype block.<br><br>In this study, genome-wide expression level polymorphisms (ELPs) were examined in a genetic cross between phenotypically distinct parasite clones of <i>P. falciparum</i> (HB3 and Dd2). Using cDNA microarray hybridizations from the progeny of a genetic cross, gene expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) were mapped in an experimental population of malaria parasites. Each gene's transcript level was used as a segregating phenotype to identify regions of the Plasmodium genome dictating transcriptional variation.<br> For further details, please refer the following publication: <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18828674">Gonzales JM, Patel JJ, Ponmee N, Jiang L, Tan A, et al. 2008 Regulatory Hotspots in the Malaria Parasite Genome Dictate Transcriptional Variation.

After formaldehyde crosslinking and saponin lysis, nuclei were separated using a 0.25M sucrose buffer cushion and sheared by sonication in a Bioruptor UCD-200 (Diagenode) for 15min at 30sec intervals (size range 100-500bp). 400-500ng DNA-containing chromatin was incubated with 1ug antibody (anti-HA, ab9110); in presence of 10ul A/G sepharose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight at 4 degrees C. After extensive washes immunoprecipitated chromatin was eluted with 1% SDS and 0.1M NaHCO3 and de-crosslinked at 65 degrees C for 4hrs. DNA was purified using PCR purification columns (Qiagen). For genome-wide analysis 24 individual ChIP reactions were combined using formaldehyde-crosslinked material. Immunoprecipitated DNA was amplified by a modified T7 linear amplification method (A. Salcedo-Amaya et al, PNAS, 2009). Briefly, DNA fragments were dephosphorylated using calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (NEB) and subsequently G-tailed with terminal transferase (NEB). T7 promoter was incorporated using Klenow polymerase (NEB) and T7C9B primer. RNA was synthesized by T7 polymerase (Ambion T7 megascript kit) and subsequently reverse transcribed using N6 primers. Amplified dsDNA was labeled with Cy3- (ChIP) or Cy5- (input) coupled random heptamers and hybridized to a tiling array at Roche NimbleGen. Zoom to 20K or less to see the probe glyphs.

Protein binding microarrays are non-organism specific and contain matches to all contiguous 10-mers at least once and non-palindromic 8-mers up to 32 times.  The DNA motifs were determined using purified recombinant AP2 domains and the resulting position weight matrix for each AP2 domain was used to search upstream regions for significant matches.  The AP2 domain that binds to each motif is indicated at the end of the gene ID.  Binding sites are based on sequence matches only and have not been verified <i>in vivo</i>. Data provided by Manuel Llinas (manuel@princeton.edu) <br>Legend: Blue represents sites that match the forward strand, Red match the reverse strand.  Darker colors have better P values than lighter colors.
